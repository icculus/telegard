- grep -i "DOS" *
- Look for calls to bslash() and isul().
- Looks for DOSisms in ifl.pas.
- Look at rec25.pas, and check for filename storage of only 8 bytes in the
  various records. Make it a full 255-character string at least.
- Looks like we've got some record clash. Hunt it out.
- Mail crashes. Record problems?
- ANSI code issues with write()
- Savescreen(), etc.
- wfc broken in xterm.
- More y2k shit
- modem/telnet support.

// end of TODO ...
