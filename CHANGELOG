    * Stubbed DOSism in file2.pas.
    * Hacked the FreePascal runtime library to convert DOS paths to Unix on
      the fly. Have not checked it, yet.
    * upgraded to FreePascal 1.1 CVS. Stuff won't build anymore. Complex AND
      and OR statements cause misgenerated ASM code. Attempting to backport
      the RTL changes to 1.0.2 ...
    * Updated Makefile to be more sane. Compiles just programs (not units),
      doesn't smartlink on debug builds, etc...

    * Initial work.
    * Wrote Makefile.
    * filenames -> lowercase, dos2unix'd them.
    * Stubbed offending DOSisms, like direct video writes and serial port i/o.
    * Commented out "uses overlay" commands.
    * Renamed newcommm.pas to newcom.pas ...
    * Fixed some other syntax stuff that doesn't fly under Free Pascal.
    * Thing builds, has startup issues, since init.pas tries to use DOS paths.

// end of CHANGELOG ...
