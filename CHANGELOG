    * Stubbed DOSism in file2.pas.
    * Hacked the FreePascal runtime library to convert DOS paths to Unix on
      the fly. Have not checked it, yet.
    * upgraded to FreePascal 1.1 CVS. Stuff won't build anymore. Complex AND
      and OR statements cause misgenerated ASM code. Attempting to backport
      the RTL changes to 1.0.2 ...
    * Updated Makefile to be more sane. Compiles just programs (not units),
      doesn't smartlink on debug builds, etc...
    * Success in getting DOS->Unix path conversion in the RTL. Submitting
      patch to FreePascal maintainers...
    * Patches to init.pas to remove DOSification.
    * Fixed (hah) Y2K bugs in multiple copies of daynum().
    * Initial reaction from FreePascal maintainers is not good; started
      converting DOSisms manually in the Telegard codebase...
    * Why can't I get GDB to recognize debug symbols in most of my code? Grr.
    * Removed remaining stubs from init.pas...this required hacking some
      data structures...I'm not sure how this worked in the DOS version in this
      state, but I'm pretty certain I've just destroyed compatibility. Oh well.
      If the Y2K bug I found is any indication, no one's using the DOS version
      anymore to be upset about this.
    * Fixed init.pas bug in make_paths()...last dir (SWAP) was not created.
    * No longer prints a caps() version of path in initp.pas's show_initfile().
    * Added NormVideo() call to end of init.pas and bbs.pas...
    * What the hell is "Project Coyote?" This is so clearly an ancient revision
      of the source, that was probably half-hacked when I got it.
    * More stubs, more filename lowercasing.

    * Initial work.
    * Wrote Makefile.
    * filenames -> lowercase, dos2unix'd them.
    * Stubbed offending DOSisms, like direct video writes and serial port i/o.
    * Commented out "uses overlay" commands.
    * Renamed newcommm.pas to newcom.pas ...
    * Fixed some other syntax stuff that doesn't fly under Free Pascal.
    * Thing builds, has startup issues, since init.pas tries to use DOS paths.

// end of CHANGELOG ...
