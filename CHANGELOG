    * More CPU burnage: put a delay() call in the loop that prompts for
      local login (yes, no, fast). This is starting to annoy me.
    * Implemented sysop1() in common.pas ... since we can't check the value
      of scroll lock, it now checks the existance of a file (GFILES/sysop.in).
      An external program/script can set this, since we aren't in a single
      tasked DOS anymore, and it shouldn't be repeated disk accesses, since
      Linux should just keep the directory entry cached.
    * Put initial work in place for myio.pas's savescreen() and friends. This
      is probably FreePascal (and Unix?) specific code, though.
    * Started fucking with socket interface. Gave up.  :)

    * Put delay(10) call in the wait for modem initialization response, to
      reduce CPU burn.
    * Put delay() call in getkey() (common.pas) to stop CPU chowing.
    * Added check to verify that the terminal is exactly 80 chars wide and
      at least 25 chars high. (mainline of bbs.pas)

    * Put delay() call in the telegard logo animation loop on the wfc menu.
      Now the logo updates a little less than three times a second, and doesn't
      starve the CPU.
    * Changed Makefile temporarily to only build bbs and init.

    * More Y2K crud. This is a slow, slow process.
    * mail0.pas's initbrd() was looking for capital filenames. Fixed.

2000-11-26  Ryan C. Gordon   <icculus@lokigames.com>
    * Changed dosansi() in common.pas to just call write() instead of a
      DOS int21h service. This allows the menus that are stored in .ANS
      files to show up on the local side, albeit incorrectly at this point.
    * Went on a Y2K rampage. Looked for places that used two-digit years, and
      started making them use 4 digits. This allowed me to remove some prior
      hacks, and make the system more robust in general. It will probably
      introduce a few bugs where the system is less obviously expecting a two
      digit year. We'll see. Some of the more obvious places where a two-digit
      year might pass through now have checks that halt() if there's a problem.
    * Changed all the INT21h-based versions of date() and time(). Have I
      mentioned yet that I'm astounded by the amount of cut-and-pasting in
      this codebase? I don't understand why they bothered to have a "common"
      unit if so much common code was just duplicated all over the place.
    * Added rcgpanic() to common.pas. Made some of the programs reference this
      unit if they weren't already. The checks for two-digit year strings call
      rcgpanic in case of trouble...this gives me a unified place to set a
      break point and backtrace in gdb...
    * init.pas filled in the init user record's birthday with a hardcoded
      '00/00/00'. logon2.pas checks for this to see if it's a new record.
      Fixed in both places. Changed cuser.pas's cstuff::doage() to accept and
      understand 4-digit years.
    * sysop3.pas showuserinfo::shi1() had an output that spilled past the 80
      char line limit once it was printing 4-digit years. Fixed.

    * Aha! I think I stumbled upon the keypressed() problem. Looks like a
      piece of the overlay code was still in there and causing problems.
      Will investigate more some other time. Ugh.
    * Changed timer() in common.pas to not use int21h services.
    * Lots more DOSisms removed. Did a grep for the DOS backslash pathchar.
    * Added TODO.
    * Hack for Y2K bug in ageuser() (common.pas).
    * Changed all implementations of exdrv(). So much code duplication...
    * Lots of the system seems to be working, now, at first glance.

2000-11-23  Ryan C. Gordon   <icculus@lokigames.com>

    * Oh my god. Almost every damn source file has {$D-} in it, which
      turns off debugging symbols. Removed, and now I can run bbs under
      GDB. Thank heavens. I wonder if {$D-} means something different under
      Turbo Pascal 6.0...in fact, there's a lot of these sort of things in
      the source that should probably be controlled via the Makefile instead.

2000-11-18  Ryan C. Gordon   <icculus@lokigames.com>

    * Stubbed DOSism in file2.pas.
    * Hacked the FreePascal runtime library to convert DOS paths to Unix on
      the fly. Have not checked it, yet.
    * upgraded to FreePascal 1.1 CVS. Stuff won't build anymore. Complex AND
      and OR statements cause misgenerated ASM code. Attempting to backport
      the RTL changes to 1.0.2 ...
    * Updated Makefile to be more sane. Compiles just programs (not units),
      doesn't smartlink on debug builds, etc...
    * Success in getting DOS->Unix path conversion in the RTL. Submitting
      patch to FreePascal maintainers...
    * Patches to init.pas to remove DOSification.
    * Fixed (hah) Y2K bugs in multiple copies of daynum().
    * Initial reaction from FreePascal maintainers is not good; started
      converting DOSisms manually in the Telegard codebase...
    * Why can't I get GDB to recognize debug symbols in most of my code? Grr.
    * Removed remaining stubs from init.pas...this required hacking some
      data structures...I'm not sure how this worked in the DOS version in this
      state, but I'm pretty certain I've just destroyed compatibility. Oh well.
      If the Y2K bug I found is any indication, no one's using the DOS version
      anymore to be upset about this.
    * Fixed init.pas bug in make_paths()...last dir (SWAP) was not created.
    * No longer prints a caps() version of path in initp.pas's show_initfile().
    * Added NormVideo() call to end of init.pas and bbs.pas...
    * What the hell is "Project Coyote?" This is so clearly an ancient revision
      of the source, that was probably half-hacked when I got it.
    * More stubs, more filename lowercasing.

2000-11-17  Ryan C. Gordon   <icculus@lokigames.com>

    * Initial work.
    * Wrote Makefile.
    * filenames -> lowercase, dos2unix'd them.
    * Stubbed offending DOSisms, like direct video writes and serial port i/o.
    * Commented out "uses overlay" commands.
    * Renamed newcommm.pas to newcom.pas ...
    * Fixed some other syntax stuff that doesn't fly under Free Pascal.
    * Thing builds, has startup issues, since init.pas tries to use DOS paths.

// end of CHANGELOG ...
