# Penguin Telegard

Penguin Telegard is an attempt at nostalgia; I have ported a chunk
of the old, DOS-based BBS package to Linux. The source is in Pascal,
so you will need the (very good) toolchain from the
[Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) website.

This project is currently not being worked on, but volunteers that
would like to tackle it are always welcome.
